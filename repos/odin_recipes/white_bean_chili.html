<h2 class="center"><em>Read along for my take on a weeknight classic</em></h2>
<p1>This is a classic go to casserole for the days when time is scarce, 
    you have a fridge full of...whatever, and you just don't want to think
    too much. I promise this will knock your' socks off and become a new family
    favorite. Even for the pickiest of eaters.
</p1>
<H2>Here is what you will need</H2>
<ul>
    <li>2 Cans Tuna (I prefer Solid White, although the brand and type is not 
        altogether important
    </li>
    <li>1 16oz bag of spirl egg noodles</li>
    <li>1 12oz can of Campbells* Cream of Mushroom Soup</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp Black Pepper</li>
    <li>1 Tsp Coarse Sea Saly</li>
    <li>1 16oz bag of shredded jack cheese (Substitute and alternative
        if you would like)</1i>
</ul>

<h3>Here's how to make it</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Pre-heat the oven to 375</li>
    <li>Set a pot with 8qt water to high. Bring to a boil</li>
    <li>Add salt to the water as it is coming up to temp</li>
    <li>Open and drain cans of tuna, add to a large mixing bowl</li>
    <li>Add half the bag of cheese, the can of soup, and the pepper to the bowl with the tuna</li>

    <li>Once the water is at boiling temperature, add the noodles. Boil for 10 minutes, or until al dente</li>
    <li>When the noodles are cooked through, drain the water and add half of the contents to a large baking dish</li>
    <li>layer the soup mixture to the noodles, then repeat. Once complete, sprinkle remaining cheese over the top</li>
    <li>Bake at 375 for 23 minutes</li>
    <li>Let it cool, serve, then Enjoy!</li>
